# Get started with Overmind

If you are moving from an existing state management solution, please read the release article [Reducing the pain of developing apps](https://medium.com/@christianalfoni/reducing-the-pain-of-developing-apps-cd10b2e6a83c).

To get started with Overmind you have to set up a project. You can do this with whatever tool your framework of choice provides or you can use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [parceljs](https://parceljs.org/). You can also use [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/) to play around with Overmind directly in the browser.

```marksy
h(TypescriptNotice, null, "Overmind requires Typescript version **3.2** or above")
```

When you have your project up and running install the Overmind dependency by using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):

```marksy
h(Example, { name: "guide/getstarted/install" })
```

Great, we are good to go!

## Our first state

Applications are about state and we are going to introduce our first state, **isLoadingPosts**. Typically you would be tempted to isolate this state in your component, but this is exactly what Overmind discourages. In Overmind you primarily define the state of your application outside of your view layer. This gives you several benefits which will become clear as we move on.

Let us imagine we get what we need from Overmind in a component:

```marksy
h(Example, { name: "guide/getstarted/loadingposts" })
```

This will of course not work. To make this work we have to create an Overmind application instance.

```marksy
h(Example, { name: "guide/getstarted/createapp" })
```

Now that we have our application, let us expose it to our component.

```marksy
h(Example, { name: "guide/getstarted/connectapp" })
```

That is it, your component will now render whenever the state accessed changes. 

## Effects

We want to load some posts from [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) when the **Posts** component mounts. This requires a side effect and we can expose any kind of side effects to our Overmind instance. Think of it as injecting libraries and tools. For example, it could be the [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) library itself, some class instance we created or just a plain object as we see in the example below. Doing this injection keeps our logic pure and Overmind knows when these injected libraries are accessed, giving you a better developer experience.

```marksy
h(Example, { name: "guide/getstarted/effects" })
```

## Loading the posts

 To run logic in Overmind you trigger **actions**. Let us define an action that is responsible for getting our application up and running.

```marksy
h(Example, { name: "guide/getstarted/actions" })
```

Finally we need to trigger our action and we will do that when the component mounts.

```marksy
h(Example, { name: "guide/getstarted/triggeraction" })
```

## Devtools

At this stage, the benefits of writing an application code this way might not be obvious. It is usually when we start to deal with more complexity that the benefits become more obvious. But even with a simple app, there is one big benefit that comes right out of the box. In our **package.json** file, we add the following and the run the script.

```marksy
h(Example, { name: "guide/getstarted/devtools" })
```

You can also explicitly install the devtools with

`npm install overmind-devtools`

and rather:

```marksy
h(Example, { name: "guide/getstarted/devtools_explicit" })
```

This allows you to control the version you want to use.

The Overmind devtools provides us with a pretty amazing experience. We get insights into all the state, changes to that state, actions run, which side effects are run and general stats. This visual overview becomes more and more valuable as complexity increases. 

To connect to the devtools simply start the devtools application and refresh your app.

## Summary

You have now stepped your toes into Overmind. Please continue this example to actually display the posts fetched. In the devtools you will see how the component will become quite bloated with dependencies to state, which is actually a general problem with lists and components. You can read more about how to manage lists in a later guide, but we wanted to point out that the devtools can already helps us identify possible issues with the application.
